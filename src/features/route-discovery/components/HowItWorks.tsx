              Route Discovery looks across your historical orders and surfaces
              high-frequency lane chains — sequences of 2–4 loads where each
              leg picks up near where the previous one dropped off, and the
              whole loop returns to your home base.
            </p>
            <p>
              Enter your home city and a search radius. We&rsquo;ll rank up to
              5 candidate routes by all-in gross rate per mile, accounting for
              empty miles between legs and the deadhead back home.

              The <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Engine
              Inspectors</span> below show <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re seeing
              what you&rsquo;re seeing — the regions we matched, how dense
              each lane is, and the typical deadhead between legs — so you can
              tell whether your radius is too tight, too loose, or the area
              just needs more order history.
